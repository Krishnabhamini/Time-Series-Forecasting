# Time-Series-Forecasting
Forecast Gold prices for the future

## Overview
In the realm of financial markets, predicting the future value of gold and silver holds significant importance for investors, traders, and stakeholders. The challenge lies in the inherent volatility and complex dynamics influencing gold prices. To address this, the objective is to develop an accurate time series forecasting model that can predict the future prices of gold. The model should leverage historical gold and silver price data.
